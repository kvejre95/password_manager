# Password Manager 
- Each entry within this database is protected with encryption, requiring a specific master password for access. This ensures that unauthorized individuals cannot view your stored passwords. Only those with the correct master password can access the content.

- It's important to note that each entry in the database can have its own unique master password, providing added security.

- For testing purposes, we have inserted dummy data into the database with the master password set to "test@123."

- To eliminate the need for environment variables, you have the option to hard-code your preferred salt value.
